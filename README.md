# regC

This repository contains data related to the transcription and  edition of the Bodleian Library's "Register C" (Library Records c.854), an account book of the
               Bodleian Library for the years 1720-1767. It records, in various hands, expenses,
               books bought, donated and given to the library as well as the moving of books to
               different shelves within the library.
               
The aim is to make available the data relating to provenance information and custodial history of the copies identified by the register (many of which are still in the Bodleian's collections today).

The project is part of a Master's thesis at Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin (MA cleLibrary and Information Science).
